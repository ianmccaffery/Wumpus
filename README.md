# Wumpus
Hunt the wumpus!
This is a project requested by Professor of Cognitive Science Bram van Heuveln from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The goal is to create a desktop application that:
1) Creates solvable "Hunt the Wumpus" game boards. (For those of you unfamiliar with the classic DOS game, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus)
2) Allows users to play a GUI-based Hunt the Wumpus on those boards manually, using their keyboards.
3) Interfaces with user-created programs designed to automatically solve the game, and gives feedback (Pass/Fail, and a runthrough of how the program failed if it did.)
4) *still under consideration* Be accessible over the web, and run within a webpage without any need for a download.

Please note that the final version of this project is not included on this git. The final version is now RPI property. For more information, please contact the author.
