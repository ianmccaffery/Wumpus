# Wumpus
Hunt the wumpus!
This is a project requested by Professor of Cognitive Science Bram van Heuveln from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The goal is to create a desktop application that:
1) Creates solvable "Hunt the Wumpus" game boards. (For those of you unfamiliar with the classic DOS game, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus)
2) Allows users to play a GUI-based Hunt the Wumpus on those boards manually, using their keyboards.
3) Interfaces with user-created programs designed to automatically solve the game, and gives feedback (Pass/Fail, and a runthrough of how the program failed if it did.)
4) *still under consideration* Be accessible over the web, and run within a webpage without any need for download.

This project began as a group project in the summer of 2020, but all algorithms, code, etc on this repository were solely written and designed by Ian McCaffery of RPI. Anyone reading this readme is free to use this project as they see fit, so long as they credit the author in some way. Note that the text file, oswald-regular, was not created by Ian.

Thank you for viewing my project.

Please note that currently, this project is designed to be used on Linux, and is untested with other operating systems. Additionally, the project is still work-in-progress, and lacks full functionality.
